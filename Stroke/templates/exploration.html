              Pulling all of the Police incidents recorded for 2020, provided us with a very large 
              dataset so we started by cleaning the data.  We first cleaned the columns in which we 
              were interested in separating the data within them.  For example, the API provided a 
              geocoded column of the latitude and longitude for each incident and we wanted to separate 
              those into their own columns for further analysis.

              We changed all columns of strings to columns of date times that provided us with date, day,
                year, and time information.  We also cleaned the columns with discrepancies in reporting. 
                For example, some districts reported had D in front of the district number while some only
              reported the number.  We added the D in front of all districts to standardize.  We dropped
                all zip codes that did not correspond to actual city of Dallas zip codes. The API provided 
                zip codes within Dallas County as a whole and some that were incorrect due to input error; 
                therefore, we removed those. We also dropped the status columns that were not significant 
                such as “L”, “Returned for Correction,” and “Open” in addition to dropping all nulls 
                provided for this column.

                system that police units use.  We only used the columns that were coded to be classified 
                within this classification system and took out all of those categories not listed here. 
                These other values were an insignificant portion of the overall dataset at only 4% of the

              After this, we label-encoded our target of status and the month column.  In addition, we 
              dummified our string columns of “division,” “district,” “day1”, and  “nibrs_crime_category.”
                We then analyzed our linear and tree-based correlations based on our features.  The label 
                and one-hot encoding we performed on for features, provided a lot of additional categories 
                so when we looked at our correlations, we took a subset of these correlating features to use 
                for our machine learning model.  We saved the linear and tree-based correlations to their own 
                data sets that we ran through our machine learning model.

                  or not suspended. Our second model then took the not suspended incidents to predict the

                  cleared.
