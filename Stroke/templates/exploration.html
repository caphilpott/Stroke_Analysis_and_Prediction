        SMOTE selects samples in the minority class that are close and then draws lines between them. New sample points are located on these lines.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        To be more precise, a random sample is chosen, and then a KNN algorithm is used to select neighbors to which lines are drawn. With this procedure, you can create as many synthetic samples as needed. This makes SMOTE perfect for datasets of all sizes. <br>
